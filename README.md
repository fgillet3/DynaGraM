# DynaGraM
**R** code of the *DynaGraM* model.  
## Content
The **R** code is divided in several scripts to reproduce the figures in the article, including supplementary figures in the Online Supplementary Material.  
Data are provided as *.RData* files, as well as simulation outputs that have been saved to avoid some long computation time. 
After downloading and unzipping the zip archive, you will have to open the main script `0_main.R` and to download the *.RData* files from the GitHub repository by running the first lines of this script.
Once you have downloaded the data files, you can run the script `0_main.R` and skip sections marked as `NOT RUN` to save computation time.
