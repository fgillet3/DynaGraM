# DynaGraM
 **R** code of the *DynaGraM* model.  
Will be made public as soon as a paper submitted to *Ecological Modelling* will be accepted.
## Content
The **R** code is divided in several scripts to reproduce the figures in the article, including supplementary figures in the Online Supplementary Material.  
Data are provided as *.RData* files, as well as simulation outputs that have been saved to avoid some long computation time. Just skip sections marked as `NOT RUN` in the main script `0_main.R`.
